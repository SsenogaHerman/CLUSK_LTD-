CUSUFEED – Premium Coffee-Husk Cattle Feed Supplement

Introducing CUSUFEED

CUSUFEED is a farm-friendly feed supplement made from upcycled coffee husks. It’s naturally rich in carbohydrates, protein and minerals (potassium, calcium, magnesium), making it a nutrient-dense fiber source for cattle. By filling out rations with high-fiber coffee husk (≈35% cellulose), CUSUFEED supports healthy digestion and curbs hunger stress in grazing animals. This clean, all-natural supplement can replace much of the traditional concentrate in diets – trials show that using up to half of a cow’s feed as coffee husk is possible without harm. As a result, farmers can cut feed costs by roughly 50% while recycling coffee processing waste.

Sustainability & Ingredients

Our feed is sourced from local coffee farms: ripe coffee cherries are harvested and processed, and the husk by-product is then transformed into CUSUFEED. This not only provides cows with fresh nutrients, but also reduces environmental waste. Coffee husks contain high levels of sugars, amino acids and bioactive compounds (from the beans’ outer skin), which can enhance rumen function. In effect, CUSUFEED is a win-win – it leverages an abundant by-product of coffee production, and helps maintain soil and air quality by diverting organic waste into livestock feed.

Key Benefits

Rich natural fiber – Coffee husk is ~35% cellulose, acting as a bulk feed to support rumen health and relieve hunger.

Enhanced digestion – Studies show processed coffee husk improves nutrient digestibility and feed conversion in cattle.

Healthy weight gain – Trials found higher daily weight gain for rams/cows fed coffee husk supplements, meaning beef and dairy herds can grow stronger.

Stable milk production – Feeding up to ~10–25% coffee husk has no negative effect on milk yield or quality, ensuring dairy farmers maintain healthy herds (with reports of even richer milk taste and quality when balanced correctly).

Massive cost savings – By replacing up to 50% of traditional concentrate with CUSUFEED, farmers save up to 50% on feed costs. This boosts profits while giving cattle a nutritious diet.

Eco-friendly & sustainable – CUSUFEED recycles coffee farm by-products, cutting waste and greenhouse gases. Using it supports local coffee growers and sustainable agriculture.


Usage & Pricing

Mix into feed: Use CUSUFEED as ~30% of the daily ration (for example, 15 kg in a 50 kg mix of forage and concentrate). Research shows up to 25% inclusion is safe. Always balance with high-protein feeds (e.g. legumes or commercial concentrates) for best results.

Packaging: Sold in 50 kg bags at UGX 50,000 each. Bulk discounts may be available for distributors.
